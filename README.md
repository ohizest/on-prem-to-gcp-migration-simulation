# On-Prem to GCP Migration Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world scenario where an organization migrates its legacy, on-premise infrastructure to **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. The workload being migrated is a Python-based web application (Flask) connected to a relational database. This project showcases my hands-on cloud engineering and migration skills — from infrastructure planning to application deployment — using cost-effective and scalable GCP services.
