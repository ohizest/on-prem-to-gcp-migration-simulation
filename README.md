# On-Prem to GCP Migration Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world scenario where an organization migrates its legacy, on-premise infrastructure to **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. The workload being migrated is a Python-based web application (Flask) connected to a relational database. This project showcases my hands-on cloud engineering and migration skills — from infrastructure planning to application deployment — using cost-effective and scalable GCP services.

##  Problem Statement

Many businesses still operate web applications on aging, on-premise servers — facing challenges such as:

- Limited scalability and resilience
- Manual deployments and poor observability
- High maintenance costs
- Risk of data loss and minimal disaster recovery

As part of my cloud engineering learning path, I created this simulation to replicate a real-life workload migration. The aim is to modernize the stack, reduce infrastructure overhead, and implement a cloud-native solution using GCP services, all while following best practices in networking, IAM, and cost optimization.
